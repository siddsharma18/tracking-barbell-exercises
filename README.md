# 🏋️‍♂️ Barbell Exercise Tracker

This is a Barbell Exercise Tracker app I built by following [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Y17yukoyy0sT2hoSQxn1TdV0J7-MX4K). It allows users to log their barbell workouts, track progress over time, and visualize performance improvements.

## 💡 Features

- Add new barbell exercises (e.g., Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press)
- Log sets, reps, and weights for each workout
- Track progress over time using charts or tables
- Export workout data to CSV
- Intuitive user interface (GUI/CLI depending on stack)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- `pandas` for data handling
- `matplotlib` or `plotly` for visualizations
- `Tkinter` or `Flask` for GUI/web interface (depending on your implementation)
- `datetime`, `os`, `csv` for file operations and date tracking
